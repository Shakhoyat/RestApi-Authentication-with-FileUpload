## 🌱 What I Learned & How I Overcame Challenges

| Challenge                  | What I Learned / How I Overcame It                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **REST API Design**        | Planned clear, RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.               |
| **Authentication**         | Implemented JWT; overcame token validation issues with middleware.  |
| **File Uploads**           | Managed `multipart/form-data` using Multer; handled edge cases for file types and storage. |
| **Error Handling**         | Built centralized error handlers for consistent, meaningful responses. |
| **Environment Variables**  | Secured sensitive data with `.env` and learned to avoid leaks.      |
| **Best Practices**         | Refactored code for modularity and scalability; followed industry standards. |
